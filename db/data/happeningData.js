The Weaveworks team will be running a full-day workshop, sharing their expertise as users and contributors of Kubernetes and Prometheus, as well as followers of GitOps (operations by pull request) practices.\n \nUsing a combination of instructor led demonstrations and hands-on exercises, the workshop will enable the attendee to go into detail on the following topics:\n \n- Developing and operating your Kubernetes microservices at scale\n \n- What does DevOps and GitOps look like in practice\n \n- Building with Kubernetes in production: caring for your apps, implementing CI/CD best practices, and utilizing the right metrics, monitoring tools, and automated alerts\n \n- Operating Kubernetes in production: Upgrading and managing Kubernetes, managing incident response, and adhering to security best practices for Kubernetes\n \nThis workshop is for you if:\n \nYou are a cluster operators/ administrators or DevOps engineers. We expect at working knowledge of Kubernetes - this course will not cover Kubernetes basics.\n \nYou have deployed a few applications to a test cluster, and now want a path forward of how to use Kubernetes in production - reliably and at scale.\n \nYour current pipeline and workflows are not bulletproof just yet and you are looking for tips and tricks to make operations smoother.\n \nPlease bring a laptop with a recent browser and wifi as we will cover hands on sessions in a sandbox environment.\n \nThis workshop doesn"t cover:\n \n- Deep knowledge of the Prometheus Query Language. Weâll be working through practical examples, but wonât cover the rest of PromQL.\n- Kubernetes Introduction and concepts. We wonât be going through an overview of Kubernetes, instead we focus on application in the real world.\n \nAgenda:\n \n- Welcome &amp; introduction\n \n- Getting started with your environment\n \n- What is âProduction Readyâ (cluster &amp; app checklist)\n \n- Monitoring a production cluster (Prometheus &amp; Observability)\n \n- Building for observability (HPA, Istio Canary, FluentD &amp; Prometheus)\n \n- Declarative infrastructure in practice (GitOps model, Infra as code)\n \n- DevOps and GitOps in practice (CI/CD pipelines, compliance tracking)\n \n- Advanced Deployment Patterns (Canary, Blue/Green, A/B testing)\n \n- Security best practices (RBAC, Kubernetes security groups, network policies)\n \n- Node management and Kubernetes upgrade\n \nLunch and refreshments will be provided.\nCosts: GBP 175\nReserve your seat https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-your-path-to-production-ready-kubernetes-tickets-63028449790\n\n \nTrainer: Brice Fernandes\nBio: Brice fell in love with programming while studying physics and never really looked back since. He has a broad technology background that covers everything from embedded C to backendless browser apps using the trendiest javascript frameworks. He taught Game Development and Functional Programming online and founded his own education platform for developers before joining Weaveworks. He now spends his time helping companies make the most of Kubernetes.\n ',

Rachel started her career in consultancy at Arthur Andersen and Ernst &amp; Young, before moving into digital product development. Sheâs worked with a wide variety of organisations, from start-ups and scale-ups to listed companies in retail, travel and housing/financial services, before joining Nationwide in 2013. Since joining the Building Society she has worked in a variety of leadership roles across digital banking, innovation and product development â and has played a lead role in Nationwideâs agile transformation story over the last 2 years.\n \nTalk: The art of going faster: 5 ways to help your team win â whatever race youâre in.\n \nWhatever business youâre in, chances are your customers are more demanding than ever before â and keeping up with expectations means going fast.\n \nGoing fast is not something that large, financial services organisations are typically very good atâ¦.but at Nationwide we know we need to be fit to compete in a rapidly changing world. Adopting the latest technology, devops, agile, lean and design-thinking can help us accelerate, but investing in technology or focusing on ways of working or process change in isolation is rarely a winning formula. [In this session] weâll explore how focusing on team environment and culture can unlock performance and speed, whether youâre working in a start-up or scale-up â or a c20,000 employee financial services organisation with a proud 100+ year history that needs to transform!\n \nScot Perham Bio -\n \nScott is a technical architect specialising in cloud computing and distributed architecture. After a decade designing and building large scale, distributed systems for various industries including defence, telecoms and games, Scott joined Polystream in 2016. In his previous role at Microsoft, where he led Lionhead"s Online Service team, he combined his profession with his passion for video games, and is now using his talent to design and run Polystream"s cloud computing/streaming platform as Platform Architect.\n \nTalk - Agility in a deep tech startup: How hard can it be?\n \nIn the three years since Polystream was formed, they have built a cloud gaming platform capable of scaling many times larger than anything else that exists, enabling millions of people around the world the ability to access streamed, interactive 3D content at unrivalled reach and scale at a fraction of the cost.\n \nAs a fast-paced technology startup, keeping up with the demands of Polystream"s deep tech culture is a challenge in itself, things change often and move incredibly fast. Knowing what Polystream would become meant that as well as the daily challenges faced in building the worlds largest cloud gaming platform, we always had an eye on the future and ensured that we had a stable foundation on which to grow all aspects of the business. In this talk we will hear some of the technical, operational and cultural challenges that faced Polystream"s engineering teams as they grew to become listed as one of the most valuable games industry startups in the UK.\n ',

Rupert Parker, Director of Future-proofing at Avison Young, one of the worldâs fastest growing real estate firms, will be talking about the impact of the Digital Twin on property investment, while Alex Wrottesley, Head of Geovation, the HM Land Registry and Ordnance Survey-supported accelerator for geospatial and property innovation will be talking about the use of geospatial data to support investment decisions.\n \nWe are partnered with The International Property Investment Network (IPIN) and our main sponsor, Pionr (www.pionr.com) warmly invite you to join them for a fascinating evening of insights and ideas from the interweaving worlds of property investment and technology, kindly hosted by Laytons LLP (www.laytons.com) at their stunning riverside offices.\n \nWe will also be running a panel discussion (details TBC), so thereâll be plenty of opportunity to get involved in the dialogue and find out more about what interests you specifically. And of course, there will be drinks and networking after the formal sessions, so you"ll have the opportunity to make new connections and swap ideas.\n \nWe expect to be oversubscribed (for our last event nearly 300 people registered for 80 spots!), so RSVP soon to avoid disappointment. If you would like to bring a guest, please ask them to join the group and register their attendance.\n \n630PM Networking, Nibbles &amp; Flash Pitches\n \n7PM Confirmed Speakers:\n8PM Panel\n \nRupert Parker, Head of Future-proofing, Avison Young (www.avisonyoung.com)\n \nRupert set up and runs Avison Youngâs startup incubator; the Entrepreneur in Residence Programme.

In his spare time, Rupert runs the very successful PropSki networking event and various spin off networking events such as PropSail, PropKart and PropShoot.\n \nTitle of Talk: The impact of the Digital Twin on property investment\n \nDescription: The Digital Twin is a term often referred to - but how often to we consider the effects of such a concept on investment? Rupert will give an introduction to his opinion of what constitutes a Digital Twin, and explore ways in which it may effect information gathering, due diligence and ultimately sale price and speed.\n \nAlex Wrottesley, Director, Geovation\n \nAlex heads up Geovation, a ground-breaking location data lab backed by Ordnance Survey (OS) and HM Land Registry and tasked with identifying and supporting innovative new businesses that use location or property data.

  description: '\n1. Adrian Bedford, Parkopedia - Affordable Adventures in Accurate RTK with the ArduSimple\nRecent advance in chip technology by an ETH spinout company Ublox, have made access to RTK GNSS solutions 1 to 2 orders of magnitude cheaper than the market leaders like OXTS. Parkopedia have recently experimented with this system and think the whole autonomous development community could benefit from the knowledge we have gained, both in what the system can offer you, but also its limitations.\n \nThe first part of the talk will be an explanation of what RTK is and why it is so precise. The second part will be a exposition of how Parkopedia uses the ArduSimple system to determine the exact location of the exits and entrances to our maps.\n \nThe details will cover solutions to problems of interacting with the NMEA ROS node, how to connect correctly to an NTRIP correction server under Linux, and how to record the raw Ublox signals for post processing.\n \n2. Andrew Bradley, Oxford Brookes - Autonomous Vehicles: Racing and Research\nThe advent of autonomous vehicles has sparked excitement in developing self-driving racing cars. Oxford Brookes University (OBU) has for many years run the UK"s most successful Formula Student racing team, and taught many of the engineers working in Formula 1. Now OBU has a team working closely alongside the Autonomous Driving research group, working hard to develop a fully self-driving racing car.\n \nThis talk will feature some of the challenges faced in developing a self-driving racing car; perception, localisation, path planning, vehicle control, and it will outline some of the live research projects which go hand-in-hand with these.\n \n3. Maysun Hassanaly and Lovedeep Brar - Safety methods for autonomous vehicle testing\nThe Autonomous Vehicle development and testing is a fast-moving and uncertain environment, which makes safety the number one priority. The application of robust Systems Engineering processes in autonomous systems development is key to ensure that all aspects and interactions in such systems are clearly defined, integrated, evaluated, tested and maintained thus improving the ability to deliver a safe, efficient and innovative system.\n \nThe Connected Places Catapult (CPC) use their expertise in systems requirements, safety management, and verification and validation working through the V lifecycle to understand the complexity of emerging multi-modal and automated transport systems, same expertise and approach is applied to develop the AVP (Autonomous Valet Parking) system.\n \nAutonomous Vehicles have the potential to make transportation more accessible and equitable along with ensuring the safety of passengers, reduce road congestion, drive smarter and in more sustainable way. By implementing a robust Systems Engineering process, the Autonomous vehicle industry can mitigate risks and drive society safely into the future.\n \nAgenda:\n \n6:30 - 7pm Networking, pizza, drinks\n \n7 - 7:30pm Adrian Bedford\n \n7:30-8:00pm Andrew Bradley\n \n8 - 8:30pm Maysun Hassanaly and Lovedeep Brar\n \n8:30pm+ Q&amp;A and networking\n \nPlease note the new address - Parkopedia has moved!\n ',
