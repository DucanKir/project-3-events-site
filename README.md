My role: Created back end and front end for users (registration, login, profile), their interaction (following users) and adding events to user profile. Homepage. 

## Functionality:

### Searching for events:
With this website the user is able to search for events and see them on the map. Each event has decription, opening times, location,  attandees and comments. 

### Attending events:
If users are loged in they are able to add events to their profile by pressing "attend" button. Chosen event will be shown on a profile page.

### User profile:
Registered users have their own profile page. They can add profile image, location, bio so that other users are able to access this information. Also users are able to follow other users when they are logd in by pressing "follow" button on the profile page. After that everyone who the user is following will be shown on a profile page.

Over the 7 day timeframe we scoped the concept for the project and divided up workflow using Trello, allowing us to work collaboratively in the most efficient way. We then built the application to MVP before expanding it with more advanced features.

We learned to work effectively as a team, and how to manage version control using Git and GitHub. The project improved our understanding of the development of full-stack web applications and the underlying technologies used to build these.
