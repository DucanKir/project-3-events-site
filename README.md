My role: Created back end and front end for users (registration, login, profile), their interaction (following users) and adding events to user profile. Homepage.

Over the 7 day timeframe we scoped the concept for the project and divided up workflow using Trello, allowing us to work collaboratively in the most efficient way. We then built the application to MVP before expanding it with more advanced features.

We learned to work effectively as a team, and how to manage version control using Git and GitHub. The project improved our understanding of the development of full-stack web applications and the underlying technologies used to build these.
